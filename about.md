# About Me

I'm a law student with a strong foundation in consumer protection and procedural law. I thrive on bridging legal theory with practical application, and I enjoy using technology to enhance legal workflows.

My academic journey is complemented by internships at consumer commissions, where I gained hands-on experience in dispute resolution and legal drafting.
